# Modified Nodal Analysis Simulator
## Folder Structure: ##
1) **Ltspice_circuit_files:** Contains the .cir files of all the circuit design files simulated in the project.
2) **Ltspice_simulation_result_files:** Contains all the results from the LTSpice simulation tool.
3) **MNAS_simulation_result_files**: Contains all the results from the MNAS simulation tool.
4) **circuit_spice_netlist_files**: Contains the spice netlists of the corresponding circuit designs under consideration.

## Files: ##
1) **modified_nodal_analysis_simulator.py**: This is the main simulator file which takes in a circuit design file from _circuit_spice_netlist_folder_ and saves the output file in _MNAS_simulation result_files_.
